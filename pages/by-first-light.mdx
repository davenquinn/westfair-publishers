<h3>A Chronicle of Baldauf Cousins</h3>

<div className="highlight">New for 2020!</div>

This substantial and unique 600 page volume presents a five-century history
(1465-1985) of the ascendants and descendants of a Baldauf family originating in
the Regensburg area of Bavaria.

Written in narrative form, commendably readable and illustrated, this history
abounds in meticulously researched, documented, verifiable, detailed facts about
the occupations, lifestyles, talents and traits of individual direct ancestors,
generation by generation through the centuries.

The index contains a little over 2400 names covering 19 generations of
Baldauf’s. If your name or the birth name of your biological parent or
grandparent is included in this end list, you are related to all but one of
those individuals.

Uniquely designed, this volume serves dual purposes. When read from front to
back, it is a continuous history. To use it as a genealogy, locate a name in the
index and follow page references that quickly trace a lineage backward to the
earliest known Baldauf ancestor.

Additional information, a broader understanding of family heritage, a comparison
of lifestyles and a description of these Baldauf’s immigration to and settling
in Ohio can be obtained by reading the bio-graphical sketches of an ancestor’s
siblings. Therefore you are encouraged to read the entire section titled Legacy,
pages 57-108.

Beginning December 2020, we are offering a limited printing of By First Light
for sale to descendants, at a cost of $_______+ ($N.nn, tbd) shipping and
handling. The book price reflects the cost of publication.
