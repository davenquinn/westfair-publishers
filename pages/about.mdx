For the **Loescher/Minch** clan: your maternal ancestry begins with a survivor of
the “Black Death” plague in 1351 who was given the surname of Leinfelder.
Details are given about direct, consecutive generations who lived in Schwaben,
Bavaria for 5 centuries.  In 1847 a family of descendants including Caroline,
Maria and Joseph Leinfelder immigrated to Lorain County, Ohio.

Caroline wed Michael Hoffmann and became the mother of Crescentia Hoffmann
**Loescher** and the grandmother of her **Loescher** children: John, Henry,
Herman, Margaret and Rose.  These Loescher sisters married **Minch** brothers,
Christian and John.

Maria Leinfelder wed Michael Klingshirn and had **Klingshirn** and **Bruder**
descendants.

Joseph Leinfelder moved his family to Jefferson, and later La Crosse, Wisconsin.

The detailed, illustrated, meticulously researched history of their direct
ancestry has been traced from 1992 back to 1351 in the hard cover book Always
With Spirit: A Leinfelder Legacy.  Memories and pictures of the **Loescher/Minch**
ancestors in **Ohio** cover **68 pages** in this unique family history. Beginning
December 2019, we are offering a limited printing of **Always With Spirit** for sale
to descendants, at a cost of $59.00 + 7.85 shipping and handling. The book price
reflects the cost of publication.
