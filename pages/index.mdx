Consecutive generations of Leinfelders lived in Schwaben Bavaria for over 500
years. In 1847, a family of descendants including, Caroline, Maria, and Joseph
Leinfelder immigrated to Lorain County, Ohio.

Caroline wed Michael Hoffman and became the mother of Crescentia Hoffman
Loescher and the grandmother of her children, John, Henry, Herman, Margaret and
Rose.  These Loescher sisters married Minch brothers Christian and John.  Maria
Leinfelder wed Michael Klingshirn and had Klingshirn and Bruder descendants.
Joseph Leinfelder moved his family to Jefferson, Wisconsin and raised his
family there and in LaCrosse.

The detailed, illustrated, and meticulously researched history of their direct
ancestry has been traced from 1992 back to 1351, in the book *Always With
Spirit: A Leinfelder Legacy*.  Tremendous in scope, this 295-page volume has
documented how the surname was bestowed, occupations, inventories of property,
marriage contracts, routes and vessels from Bavaria to Ohio and triumphs and
tragedies of succeeding generations and revelations of their lifestyle, talents
and traits.
